# Welcome to the Creating a Discord Bot on Compute Engine Workshop! ðŸ“£

In this workshop you will learn to use the Discord.py library to create your own discord bot on Google Compute Engine that replies to your messages and returns weather information using the OpenWeather API.

We know you're excited, but let's make sure that you have everything to get started:
- Internet âœ…
- Python âœ…
- Required Python Libraries âœ…
- Google Account âœ…

Once this workshop is complete you will be able to make a basic discord bot that replies to your messages, calls and retrieves information from an external API, and runs 24/7 using a Virtual Machine in GCP on Compute Engine.

## Without further ado let's get started!!
